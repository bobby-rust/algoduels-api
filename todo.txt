run code          [x]
populate db with problems and test cases [ ]

----- implement algorithm to test solution given source code ------  
----- need to standardize a test data structure -------------------
----- maybe json some test cases and write a script to load into db
----- tough to plan, just start implementing agile style for now --
----- I'm unsure what problems i'll run into, can't solve a problem
----- I can't define. ---------------------------------------------
Steps:
    fetch test cases
    results = []
    for each test case
        output = execute(testcase.input)
        compare textcase.expectedOutput to output
        push test case results to results
        if test case failed:
            return results, tests failed

    return results, tests succeedded

------ Matchmaking ----
set up web sockets [ ]
implement queue [ ]
implement matchmaking algorithm [ ]



----- Account -------
create account    [x]
get account       [ ] // this is needed to view profiles, but not necessary for mvp
update account    [ ] // doesn't matter yet, lower prio
delete account    [ ] // same


--- Submission ------
/* 
 * Only accepted submissions will be stored in DB,
 * one per problem per user. To be used later for
 * problem solutions and to show users their previous solutions
 */
create submission [ ]
get submission    [ ]

=============================

NOT NECESSARY FOR INITIAL APP
CAN MANUALLY DO THESE + THEYRE STATIC
----- Problem -------
create problem    [ ]

------ Testcase ------
create testcase   [ ]
get testcases     [ ] // by problem id
