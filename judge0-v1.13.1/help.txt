The easiest way to connect to the postgres db running in a docker container 
directly from the host machine is to
map port 5432 of the host machine to port 5432 of the container,

i.e., add:
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

under `db` in docker-compose.yaml,
where the first port corresponds to that port on the host machine. 
This causes any traffic sent to the first port on the host machine 
to be forwarded to the second port in the docker container environment
